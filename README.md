Very simply stack data structure. This stack gives the programmer the option to push(), pop(), display(), and peek(). The push() allows the programmer to insert data into the top of the stack. the pop() allows the 
programmer to delete the data at the top of  the stack. The display() functon will output the data in the stack. The peek() function allows the user to return the data at the top of the stack
